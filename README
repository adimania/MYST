==Introduction==
MYST is a python-twitter application. It can be used to tweet commandline.
It uses oauth for authentication.

==Authentication Method==
Step 1: Open https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
Step 2: Fill the form. Put the name as 'MYST-<anything>' and website as 'http://myst.adityapatawari.com'
Step 3: Check out the permissions in "settings" tab. Grant permission based on what you expect Myst to do.
Step 4: Edit the conf file to put relevant details and place it in you home directory named as .myst.conf

==What is monitor.sh?==
monitor.sh is a simple script which collects some basic info about your machine.
Idea is to create a private twitter account and you can put the follwing in a cron to get updates about your server's health:
$ cd myst
$ ./myst.py -t `~/Documents/progs/monitor.sh`

Make sure that you do not tweet anything which can expose your server's vulnerability. Stick to the default monitor.sh, if you are not sure.

==What is system execution mode?==
In system execution mode, your server will perform those tasks which are Directly Messaged (DM) to it, provided the person who is sending the DM is in authorized list of users.
Just add the authorized users to ~/.myst.conf in a space separated fashion to "auth_users" in "Users" section.
